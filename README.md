# Maze Game

## Play the Game
The game is hosted on Unity Play [here](https://play.unity.com/en/games/2246de74-8456-463d-b412-aa0a8f5eff2e/maze-game).

## About the Project
I made this game with the Unity game engine.  The scripting is coded in C#.  I wanted to try making a game with Unity and experiment with maze generating algorithms.

## Note
I created this repository to show off the project, but I didn't actually use git/GitHub for version control while developing it.  That is why there is no code in the repo.
Maybe some day I'll upload some of the code.
